We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion or nationality.

## Expected Behaviour

* Be kind and courteous.
* Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Provide constructive feedback and criticism.
* Accept responsibility and apologise to those affected by our mistakes.
* Focus on what is best for the community and the project.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

* The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable behaviour.

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project team at `conduct@ioaproject.org`.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

We strive to create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants.
