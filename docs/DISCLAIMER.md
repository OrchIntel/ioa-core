## Non-AGI Statement

**IOA Core is NOT an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system, "Operating System for AGI," or autonomous intelligence platform.** IOA Core is a multi-agent orchestration framework designed for research, experimentation, and prototyping of memory-driven agent collaboration patterns.

### What IOA Core IS

IOA Core is a **development framework** that provides:
- Multi-agent task routing and collaboration mechanisms
- Persistent memory systems with pattern recognition
- Governance simulation for agent behavior modification
- Consensus formation protocols for multi-agent decision making
- Research tools for studying emergent agent behaviors

### What IOA Core is NOT

IOA Core does **NOT**:
- Exhibit general intelligence or autonomous reasoning capabilities
- Replace human decision-making or supervision
- Provide production-ready AI solutions out of the box
- Guarantee any specific performance or behavioral outcomes
- Offer AGI-level understanding or consciousness simulation

## Intended Use Cases

### ✅ Appropriate Uses

- **Academic Research**: Studying multi-agent system behaviors and emergent properties
- **Prototype Development**: Building proof-of-concept agent collaboration systems
- **Educational Projects**: Learning about agent architectures and memory systems
- **Experimental Development**: Testing new approaches to agent coordination
- **Research Simulation**: Exploring governance mechanisms in multi-agent environments

### ❌ Inappropriate Uses

- **Production Applications**: Without significant security hardening and enterprise extensions
- **Mission-Critical Systems**: Where system failure could cause harm or significant losses
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: For high-stakes decisions requiring human oversight
- **Real-World Deployment**: Without proper security assessment and risk mitigation
- **Commercial Applications**: Without understanding licensing and liability implications

## Licensing and Commercial Use

### Open Source Core License

IOA Core is released under the **Apache 2.0 License**, which permits:
- Use in commercial and non-commercial projects

## Security and Compliance Disclaimers

### Development-Grade Security Warning

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE ⚠️**

IOA Core OSS includes **development-grade security implementations** that are **NOT suitable for production use**:

- **Trust signatures use placeholder keys** with no cryptographic security
- **Agent code execution is NOT sandboxed** and can access system resources
- **Memory data is stored in plaintext** without encryption
- **GDPR data erasure methods are stub implementations** and not legally compliant
- **No production-grade authentication** or access controls

### Compliance Limitations

IOA Core OSS does **NOT provide**:
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data erasure functions return `NotImplementedError`
- **HIPAA Readiness**: No healthcare-grade security or audit controls
- **SOC2 Framework**: No standardized security and availability controls
- **Industry Standards**: No sector-specific compliance implementations

For compliance requirements, enterprise implementation is required.

### Data Processing and Privacy

IOA Core OSS:
- Stores agent memory and conversation data locally in plaintext
- Does not implement data retention or automatic deletion policies
- May log agent interactions and system operations for debugging
- Does not provide data anonymization or pseudonymization
- Does not include consent management frameworks

**Users are responsible for**:
- Implementing appropriate data protection measures
- Ensuring compliance with applicable privacy regulations
- Managing user consent and data subject rights
- Securing system deployment and access controls

## Simulation and Research Limitations

### Experimental Nature

IOA Core simulations and behavioral results are:
- **Experimental and exploratory** in nature
- **Subject to variability** based on configuration and inputs
- **Not validated for real-world applications** without additional testing
- **Limited by current LLM capabilities** and may exhibit known biases
- **Dependent on external services** (OpenAI API, etc.) with their own limitations

### Result Interpretation

Simulation results should be interpreted as:
- **Research data points** rather than predictive models
- **Proof-of-concept demonstrations** of architectural possibilities
- **Starting points for further investigation** rather than final conclusions
- **System behavior patterns** under specific test conditions

### Academic and Research Use

When citing IOA Core in academic work:
- Clearly identify the experimental nature of results
- Include appropriate disclaimers about production readiness
- Reference specific version numbers and configuration parameters
- Acknowledge limitations and scope of testing performed

## Liability and Warranty Disclaimers

### No Warranty

IOA Core is provided **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind, including:
- No guarantee of functionality, performance, or security
- No warranty of merchantability or fitness for particular purpose
- No assurance of continuous availability or support
- No protection against data loss, system failure, or security breaches

### Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- Contributors and maintainers are not liable for any damages arising from use
- No responsibility for data loss, system failures, or security incidents
- Users assume all risks associated with deployment and operation
- Limitation applies to direct, indirect, incidental, and consequential damages

### User Responsibility

Users of IOA Core are responsible for:
- Conducting appropriate security assessments before deployment
- Implementing necessary safeguards and monitoring systems
- Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Maintaining backups and disaster recovery procedures
- Supervising agent operations and preventing harmful behaviors
