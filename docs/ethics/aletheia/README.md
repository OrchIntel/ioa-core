# Ethics Frameworks: Aletheia v2.0 Reference

## Overview

IOA Core provides runtime governance and evidence generation capabilities that complement established AI ethics frameworks. This document references the Rolls-Royce Aletheia Framework v2.0 as an example of how engineering teams can integrate ethics assessment methodologies with runtime enforcement systems.

## Disclaimer

**Experimental Integration - Educational and Research Use Only**

The ethics integration features described in this document, including references to the Rolls-Royce Aletheia Framework v2.0, are **experimental and educational only**. These features are not intended for production use, commercial implementation, or regulatory compliance purposes.

**Key Warnings:**
- **No Compliance Guarantee**: Does not guarantee compliance with any ethical standards or legal requirements
- **Research Status**: Currently operationalizes approximately 65% of referenced ethical assessment facets
- **Performance**: Experimental-grade characteristics (not production-optimized)
- **Liability**: IOA maintainers are not liable for any damages arising from use of these features

**Acceptable Use:**
- Academic research and education
- Proof-of-concept demonstrations
- Learning and experimentation

**Prohibited Use:**
- Production systems or commercial applications
- Regulatory compliance or certification
- Safety-critical or high-risk systems

For complete legal terms, see the [Ethics Integration Legal Disclaimer](../../legal/ethics_disclaimer.md).

## Aletheia Framework v2.0

The Aletheia Framework v2.0 by Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace provides a comprehensive toolkit for AI ethics assessment, including:

- **Systematic bias detection** across multiple protected attributes
- **Stakeholder engagement** methodologies for diverse perspective inclusion
- **Documentation standards** for ethics evaluation processes
- **Assessment tools** for measuring AI system fairness and alignment

## IOA Integration Approach

IOA Core complements ethics frameworks like Aletheia by providing:

### Runtime Enforcement
- **Real-time policy application** based on ethics assessment findings
- **Multi-LLM consensus** mechanisms to reduce bias through diverse model perspectives
- **Continuous monitoring** of ethical compliance during system operation

### Evidence Generation
- **Cryptographic audit trails** documenting all ethics-related decisions
- **Tamper-evident logs** providing verifiable proof of ethical compliance
- **Export capabilities** for integration with compliance and audit systems

### Practical Workflow
1. **Assessment Phase**: Use Aletheia to identify ethical risks and establish baseline metrics
2. **Policy Creation**: Translate Aletheia findings into IOA runtime policies
3. **Runtime Monitoring**: IOA enforces ethical policies during system operation
4. **Evidence Collection**: Generate cryptographic proof of ethical compliance
5. **Audit Integration**: Export evidence for compliance reporting and verification

## Example Use Case

```
Aletheia Assessment: "AI loan system shows 15% bias against protected groups"
↓
IOA Policy: Create fairness cartridge monitoring bias thresholds
↓
Runtime Enforcement: Block decisions exceeding ethical thresholds
↓
Evidence Chain: Log all fairness decisions with cryptographic proof
↓
Audit Report: Demonstrate continuous compliance with Aletheia findings
```
