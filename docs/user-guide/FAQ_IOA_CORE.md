### Q: How do I install IOA Core?

**A:** IOA Core can be installed using pip or from source:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install ioa-core

# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ioa-core.git
cd ioa-core
pip install -e .
```

### Q: What are the system requirements?

**A:** IOA Core requires:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 2GB disk space
- Internet connection for LLM provider access

### Q: How do I configure LLM providers?

**A:** Use the onboarding CLI to configure providers:

> **Note**: Some commands below are examples for future functionality.

```bash
# Add OpenAI provider
# Example (not currently implemented): ioa onboard add openai --key your-api-key

# Add Anthropic provider
# Example (not currently implemented): ioa onboard add anthropic --key your-api-key

# List configured providers
# Example (not currently implemented): ioa onboard list
```

### Q: What environment variables do I need to set?

**A:** Key environment variables include:

```bash
# Required for non-interactive environments
export IOA_NON_INTERACTIVE=1

# LLM provider API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key

# Performance testing
export IOA_100K_N=100000
```

## Performance & Testing

### Q: How do I run performance tests?

**A:** Use the built-in performance test suite:

> **Note**: Some commands below are examples for future functionality.

```bash
# Run 100k performance tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/test_100k.py -v

# Run with custom iterations
# IOA_100K_N=50000 python -m pytest tests/performance/
```

### Q: What's the expected performance for 100k tests?

**A:** Performance varies by system, but typical results are:
- **Fast systems (c5.4xlarge)**: 30-60 seconds
- **Standard systems (c5.2xlarge)**: 60-120 seconds
- **Development machines**: 2-5 minutes

### Q: How do I optimize performance?

**A:** Performance optimization tips:

> **Warning**: The following contains potentially destructive commands. 
> Review carefully before execution.

> **Warning**: The following contains potentially destructive commands. 
> Review carefully before execution.

> **Note**: Some commands below are examples for future functionality.

```bash
# Set CPU governor to performance
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Disable swap for better performance
# sudo swapoff -a

# Use dedicated instances for testing
# Monitor system resources during tests
```

### Q: How do I monitor system resources during tests?

**A:** Use system monitoring tools:

> **Note**: Some commands below are examples for future functionality.

```bash
# Monitor CPU and memory
# htop

# Monitor disk I/O
# iotop

# Monitor network
# iftop

# System load
# uptime
```

- Tenant isolation and scoping
- Compliance monitoring (GDPR, etc.)
- Policy enforcement and validation

### Q: How do I enable audit logging?

**A:** Audit logging is configured in governance config:

```yaml
governance:
  audit:
    enabled: true
    rotation_days: 30
    retention_days: 365
    log_level: INFO
```

### Q: What compliance standards are supported?

**A:** IOA Core supports:
- GDPR compliance
- Data retention policies
- Audit trail requirements
- Privacy protection measures
- Regulatory reporting

## Workflow & Execution

### Q: How do I create and execute workflows?

**A:** Workflows can be created using the workflow executor:

```python
from src.workflow_executor import WorkflowExecutor

# Create workflow
workflow = {
    "name": "data_processing",
    "steps": [
        {"action": "extract", "source": "database"},
        {"action": "transform", "method": "normalize"},
        {"action": "load", "target": "warehouse"}
    ]
}

# Execute workflow
executor = WorkflowExecutor()
result = executor.execute(workflow)
```

### Q: How do I handle workflow errors?

**A:** Error handling is built into the workflow system:

```python
# Configure error handling
workflow = {
    "error_handling": {
        "retry_count": 3,
        "retry_delay": 5,
        "fallback_action": "rollback"
    }
}
```

### Q: Can workflows be scheduled?

**A:** Yes, workflows support scheduling:

```python
# Schedule workflow
executor.schedule_workflow(
    workflow_id="daily_report",
    schedule="0 9 * * *",  # Daily at 9 AM
    timezone="UTC"
)
```

## Memory & Storage

### Q: How does IOA Core manage memory?

**A:** Memory management features include:

- Automatic garbage collection

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s --tb=long
```

### Q: How do I add new tests?

**A:** Adding new tests:

```python
# Create test file
# tests/test_new_feature.py

import pytest
from src.new_feature import NewFeature

def test_new_feature_functionality():
    """Test new feature functionality."""
    feature = NewFeature()
    result = feature.process("test_data")
    assert result == "expected_output"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: What do I do if tests fail?

**A:** Troubleshooting steps:
