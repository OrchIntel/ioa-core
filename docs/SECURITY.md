# Security Policy
Version: v2.5.0
Last Updated: 2025-08-08
Description: Security policy and vulnerability disclosure for IOA Core OSS
License: IOA Dev Confidential – Internal Use Only

## Project Security Scope

**IOA Core v2.5.0** is a **development-grade** multi-agent orchestration framework designed for research, experimentation, and prototyping. This OSS release is **NOT intended for production use** without significant security hardening and advanced security extensions.

### Development vs Production Classification

| Security Feature | IOA Core OSS | IOA Organization | Production Ready |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Agent Trust Registry | ✅ SHA-256 Demo | ✅ Hardware Security Module | Organization Only |
| Code Execution Sandboxing | ❌ None | ✅ Containerized Isolation | Organization Only |
| Memory Encryption | ❌ Plaintext | ✅ AES-256 Encryption | Organization Only |
| GDPR Data Erasure | ⚠️ Stub Implementation | ✅ Audit-Compliant Deletion | Organization Only |
| Multi-tenant Isolation | ⚠️ Basic Config | ✅ Network Segmentation | Organization Only |
| Access Controls | ❌ Development Keys | ✅ Certificate-Based Auth | Organization Only |

## Trust Signature Mechanism

IOA Core implements a **demonstration-grade** trust registry system using SHA-256 hash verification. This system provides basic agent authentication for development environments but **should never be used in production**.

### Current Implementation

```python
# Example trust signature (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
"signature_keys": {
  "default": {
    "public_key": "5d19bd2b8a301f97f4e219df349d697498d0785bd761a8c069ad5fd69380bfb4",
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "key_type": "Hex"
  }
}
```

### ⚠️ Critical Security Warning

**These signature keys are placeholder examples and provide NO cryptographic security.** They are included for:
- Development testing of agent onboarding workflows
- Demonstration of trust registry architecture
- Integration testing and simulation purposes

**Production Requirements:**
- Replace with Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
    - Implement certificate-based agent authentication with proper PKI
    - Use rotating keys with secure key management
    - Enable signature verification with secure timestamp validation

## New in v2.5.0

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Agent onboarding now supports RSA/ECDSA keys for secure identity
verification.  Key pairs are generated and stored securely by
`agent_onboarding.py`, and signatures are validated against a
trusted root.  This enhancement prevents unauthorised agents from
registering with the system.

### GDPR Erasure Stub

The `memory_engine.py` now exposes a `gdpr_erase` stub that records and
forwards erasure requests to downstream storage tiers.  While full
erasure is implemented in the organization edition, this stub allows
applications built on the core edition to begin integrating GDPR
compliance flows.

## Known Vulnerabilities

### 1. Non-Sandboxed Agent Execution

**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

Agent code execution is **NOT sandboxed or isolated**. Malicious or compromised agents can:
- Access the underlying file system
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Modify memory data of other agents
- Access configuration files and trust registry

**Mitigation for Production:**
- Implement container-based agent isolation
- Use restricted execution environments (chroot, docker, etc.)
- Apply capability-based security controls
- Monitor and audit all agent operations

### 2. Plaintext Memory Storage

**Risk Level: HIGH**

All agent memory data is stored in **plaintext JSON format** without encryption:
- Sensitive conversation history exposed
- No protection against unauthorized access
- Memory export functions reveal all data

**Mitigation for Production:**
- Implement AES-256 memory encryption
- Use encrypted storage backends
- Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Implement secure key management

### 3. Configuration Exposure

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

Configuration files contain:
- Trust registry with demo keys
- Agent capability definitions
- Routing and governance parameters
- Potentially sensitive system paths

**Mitigation for Production:**
- Move sensitive config to secure vaults
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Use encrypted configuration management
- Apply least-privilege access controls

### 4. Basic Authentication

**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

Current authentication mechanisms are:
- Development-grade placeholder implementations
- No session management or token validation
- Limited to basic trust score validation

**Mitigation for Production:**
- Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- Add session management and token validation
- Use multi-factor authentication
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC)

## Security Guidelines for Developers

### Safe Development Practices

When working with IOA Core:

> **Note**: Some commands below are examples for future functionality.

```bash
# Use isolated environments
python -m venv ioa-dev
# source ioa-dev/bin/activate

# Never run with elevated privileges
# Never use in production without security review
# Always validate input data from external sources
```

### Secure Configuration

```yaml
# governance.config.yaml - Development Settings
roundtable_mode_enabled: true
consensus_threshold: 0.7
pattern_court_enabled: true
vad_emotion_enabled: true
debug_flags:
  - trace-routing  # OK for development
  # NEVER enable in production:
  # - expose-keys
  # - disable-validation
```

### Agent Development Security

When creating custom agents:

```python
# DO: Validate all inputs
def process_user_input(self, input_data):
    if not self.validate_input(input_data):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input detected")
    
# DON'T: Execute arbitrary code
def unsafe_execution(self, code):
    exec(code)  # NEVER DO THIS
    
# DO: Use capability restrictions
@capability_required("text_generation")
def generate_response(self, prompt):
    return self.llm_service.generate(prompt)
```
