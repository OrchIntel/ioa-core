# IOA Governance Framework

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-03  
**Status:** Active - OSS Launch Gate

## Overview

The IOA Governance Framework provides a comprehensive, enforceable governance system for AI operations. Built around the **System Laws** - a set of signed, external governance rules - this framework ensures that governance is kernel-level, testable, and certifiable.

## Core Components

### 1. System Laws

The foundation of IOA governance consists of six core laws:

1. **Compliance Supremacy** - Regulatory compliance takes precedence
2. **Governance Precedence** - Governance policies override operational decisions
3. **Auditability** - Complete audit trails for all actions
4. **Immutable Governance** - Automated actions cannot override core governance
5. **Fairness & Non-Discrimination** - Bias detection and mitigation
6. **Human Oversight Supremacy** - Human approval for blocked actions

### 2. Policy Engine

The Policy Engine enforces System Laws by:

- Validating all actions against governance rules
- Calculating fairness scores and detecting bias
- Managing conflict resolution between laws
- Emitting policy events for monitoring
- Creating HITL tickets for human approval

### 3. Connector Guardrails

All external integrations must pass through governance validation:

- Capability validation against System Laws
- Jurisdiction and data classification enforcement
- Rate limiting and security clearance checks
- Audit trail generation for all operations

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Human oversight capabilities include:

- Approval workflows for blocked actions
- Emergency override capabilities
- Complete audit trails for human decisions
- Integration with Command Deck interfaces

## Governance Flow

### Action Validation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User/System
    participant Policy as Policy Engine
    participant Laws as System Laws
    participant HITL as Human Approval
    participant Audit as Audit System
    
    User->>Policy: Action Request
    Policy->>Laws: Validate Against Laws
    
    alt Action Compliant
        Laws-->>Policy: Approved
        Policy->>Audit: Log Approval
        Policy-->>User: Execute Action
    else Action Blocked
        Laws-->>Policy: Blocked
        Policy->>HITL: Create Ticket
        Policy->>Audit: Log Block
        Policy-->>User: Action Blocked
    else Approval Required
        Laws-->>Policy: Requires Approval
        Policy->>HITL: Create Ticket
        Policy->>Audit: Log Pending
        Policy-->>User: Wait for Approval
        
        HITL->>User: Human Decision
        User->>HITL: Approve/Reject
        HITL->>Audit: Log Decision
        HITL-->>User: Decision Result
    end
```

### Connector Integration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Connector as External Connector
    participant Guard as Connector Guardrails
    participant Policy as Policy Engine
    participant Audit as Audit System
    
    Connector->>Guard: Execute Action

    Policy->>Audit: Log Validation
    
    alt Capabilities Valid
        Policy-->>Guard: Approved
        Guard->>Connector: Execute with Context
        Connector->>Audit: Log Execution
    else Capabilities Invalid
        Policy-->>Guard: Blocked
        Guard->>Connector: Action Blocked
        Guard->>Audit: Log Block
    end
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Policy Engine Integration

The Policy Engine integrates with all major IOA components:

```python
# Example integration in roundtable executor
from src.ioa.core.governance.policy_engine import PolicyEngine

class RoundtableExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.policy_engine = PolicyEngine()
    
    def execute_action(self, action_context):
        # Validate against System Laws before execution
        validation_result = self.policy_engine.validate_against_laws(action_context)
        
        if validation_result.status == "blocked":
            raise ActionBlockedError("Action blocked by System Laws")
        
        if validation_result.status == "requires_approval":
            # Create HITL ticket and wait for approval
            hitl_ticket = self._create_hitl_ticket(action_context, validation_result)
            raise ApprovalRequiredError(f"Human approval required: {hitl_ticket['ticket_id']}")
        
        # Execute action with audit trail
        result = self._execute_action(action_context)
        result["audit_id"] = validation_result.audit_id
        return result
```

### 2. Connector Integration

All connectors must inherit from the base class:

```python
from src.ioa.connectors.base import ConnectorBase, ConnectorCapabilities

class MyConnector(ConnectorBase):
    def __init__(self):
        capabilities = ConnectorCapabilities(
            name="My Connector",
            version="1.0.0",
            supported_actions=["read", "write"],
            data_classifications=["public", "internal"],
            jurisdictions=["global"]
        )
        super().__init__("my-connector", capabilities)
    
    def _execute_action(self, action_type, ctx, **kwargs):
        # Implement actual connector logic
        return {"result": "success"}
```

### 3. HITL Integration

Human approval workflows integrate with Command Deck:

```python
from apps.command_deck.hitl import create_hitl_ticket, is_ticket_approved

# Create HITL ticket
ticket = create_hitl_ticket(
    connector_id="my-connector",
    action_type="data_export",
    actor_id="user-123",
    required_approvals=[{"law_id": "law1", "details": "GDPR compliance review"}]
)

# Check approval status
if is_ticket_approved(ticket["ticket_id"]):
    # Proceed with action
    pass
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

  affinity: ["EU", "US", "air-gapped"]
  conflict_rules:
    GDPR_vs_SOX: "GDPR takes precedence for EU data"
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics

Monitor these governance metrics:

1. **Policy Violations**
   - Count of law violations per time period
   - Types of violations and frequency
   - Resolution time for violations

2. **HITL Performance**
   - Number of pending approval requests
   - Average time to human decision
   - Approval/rejection ratios

3. **Fairness Metrics**
   - Distribution of fairness scores
   - Bias detection frequency
   - Mitigation strategy effectiveness

4. **Audit Coverage**
   - Percentage of actions with complete audit trails
   - Audit trail completeness scores
   - Missing audit data incidents

### Policy Events

The system emits structured policy events:

```json
{
  "event_type": "action_validated",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-03T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "action_id": "action-123",
    "audit_id": "audit-456",
    "status": "approved",
    "laws_checked": ["law1", "law2", "law3"],
    "violations": [],
    "required_approvals": [],
    "fairness_score": 0.1,
    "processing_time_ms": 45
  }
}
```

## Compliance and Certification

### "Powered by IOA" Badge

Organizations can achieve the "Powered by IOA" certification by:

1. **Implementing System Laws** - All governance rules enforced
2. **Passing Conformance Tests** - All validation tests succeed
3. **Maintaining Audit Trails** - Complete traceability of operations
