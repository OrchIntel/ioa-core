**Status:** Active - OSS Launch Gate

## Overview

The IOA Conformance Guide provides a comprehensive checklist for achieving the "Powered by IOA" certification. This certification demonstrates that an organization's AI systems comply with IOA's governance standards and can be safely deployed in production environments.

## "Powered by IOA" Certification

### What It Means

The "Powered by IOA" badge indicates that an AI system:

1. **Enforces System Laws** - All actions comply with governance rules
2. **Maintains Audit Trails** - Complete traceability of all operations
3. **Ensures Fairness** - Bias detection and mitigation active
4. **Provides Human Oversight** - Human approval workflows functional
5. **Passes Conformance Tests** - All validation tests succeed

### Benefits

- **Trust & assurance** - Demonstrated commitment to responsible AI
- **Compliance Ready** - Built-in governance for regulatory requirements
- **Risk Mitigation** - Automated detection of governance violations
- **Operational Excellence** - Human oversight for high-risk decisions
- **Market Differentiation** - Industry-leading governance standards

## Conformance Checklist

### 1. System Laws Verification

**Critical Requirement:** System Laws manifest must be loaded and verified at startup.

- [ ] **Manifest Loading:** `system_laws.json` loads without errors
- [ ] **Signature Verification:** RSA/ECDSA signature validates successfully
- [ ] **Structure Validation:** JSON schema validation passes
- [ ] **Startup Gate:** IOA fails fast if verification fails
- [ ] **Key Management:** Public key accessible and valid

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Verify manifest loads
python -c "from src.ioa.core.governance.manifest import load_manifest; load_manifest()"
```

**Failure Criteria:** Any startup failure due to manifest issues blocks certification.

### 2. Policy Enforcement

**Critical Requirement:** All actions must be validated against System Laws before execution.

- [ ] **Pre-Execution Validation:** Policy checks occur before side effects
- [ ] **Law Coverage:** All 6 laws are enforced
- [ ] **Priority Order:** Conflict resolution follows defined hierarchy
- [ ] **Real-time Enforcement:** No bypass mechanisms exist
- [ ] **Performance:** Validation adds <100ms to action execution

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run policy enforcement tests
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py::TestPolicyEngine -v
```

**Failure Criteria:** Any action executes without policy validation blocks certification.

### 3. Audit Trail Completeness

**Critical Requirement:** Every governed action must have a unique audit_id.

- [ ] **Unique IDs:** No duplicate audit_id values
- [ ] **Complete Context:** Action metadata preserved
- [ ] **Policy Results:** Validation outcomes recorded
- [ ] **Timestamps:** UTC timestamps with timezone awareness
- [ ] **Traceability:** Full action chain traceable

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run audit trail tests
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py::TestSystemLawsIntegration::test_audit_id_propagation -v
```

**Failure Criteria:** Any action without audit_id blocks certification.

### 4. Fairness Guard Functionality

**High Priority:** Bias detection and mitigation must be active.

- [ ] **Threshold Enforcement:** Fairness threshold (0.2) enforced
- [ ] **Bias Detection:** Demographic and content bias detected
- [ ] **Mitigation Strategies:** Violations trigger mitigation
- [ ] **Metrics Calculation:** Gini coefficient and disparity ratios computed
- [ ] **Human Escalation:** High bias scores require human review

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run fairness tests
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py::TestPolicyEngine::test_fairness_violation_detection -v
```

**Failure Criteria:** Fairness violations not detected or mitigated blocks certification.

### 5. Human Oversight (HITL)

**High Priority:** Human approval workflows must be functional.

- [ ] **Ticket Creation:** HITL tickets generated for blocked actions
- [ ] **Approval Workflow:** Human operators can approve/reject
- [ ] **Audit Trail:** All decisions recorded with rationale
- [ ] **Override Capability:** Emergency overrides available
- [ ] **Integration:** HITL endpoints accessible via API

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run HITL tests
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py::TestSystemLawsIntegration::test_hitl_override_functionality -v
```

**Failure Criteria:** HITL workflows not functional blocks certification.

### 6. Connector Guardrails

**Medium Priority:** External integrations must respect policy enforcement.

- [ ] **Capability Validation:** Connector capabilities verified
- [ ] **Jurisdiction Enforcement:** Geographic constraints respected
- [ ] **Data Classification:** Data handling rules enforced
- [ ] **Rate Limiting:** Usage limits enforced
- [ ] **Security Clearance:** Risk-based access controls

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run connector tests
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py::TestConnectorGuardrails -v
```

**Failure Criteria:** Connectors bypass policy enforcement blocks certification.

### 7. Conformance Test Suite

**Critical Requirement:** All conformance tests must pass.

- [ ] **Test Coverage:** >90% code coverage for governance modules
- [ ] **Test Execution:** All tests pass without errors
- [ ] **Performance Tests:** Validation performance within limits
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflows validated
- [ ] **Failure Scenarios:** Error conditions properly handled

**Test Command:**
```bash
# Run full conformance suite
pytest tests/conformance/test_conformance_laws.py -v --cov=src.ioa.core.governance --cov-report=html
```

**Failure Criteria:** Any test failure blocks certification.

### 8. Documentation and Training

**Medium Priority:** Complete documentation and training materials available.

- [ ] **System Laws Spec:** Complete law specifications documented
- [ ] **Implementation Guide:** Step-by-step implementation instructions
- [ ] **API Documentation:** All governance APIs documented
- [ ] **Training Materials:** Operator training available
- [ ] **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions documented

**Verification:** Documentation review by governance team.
