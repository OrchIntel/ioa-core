    def monitor_compliance(self):
        """Monitor compliance in real-time."""
        current_status = self._check_current_compliance()
        
        # Check for violations
        violations = self._identify_violations(current_status)
        
        if violations:
            self._handle_violations(violations)
        
        # Update compliance status
