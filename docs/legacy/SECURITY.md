## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by emailing: `security@orchintel.com`

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues

## Security Considerations for IOA Core

### Trust System Limitations

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING** ⚠️

The trust signature system in IOA Core is **FOR DEVELOPMENT USE ONLY**. 

**Example keys in the trust registry are NOT SECURE:**
```
"public_key": "5d19bd2b8a301f97f4e219df349d697498d0785bd761a8c069ad5fd69380bfb4"
```

These are sample SHA-256 hashes generated for demonstration. **Never use these keys in production.**

### Agent Onboarding Security

The agent onboarding system provides basic validation but should not be considered a security boundary:

1. **Manifest Validation**: JSON schema validation only - not cryptographic verification
2. **Trust Signatures**: Development placeholders - implement proper PKI for production
3. **Tenant Isolation**: Basic namespace separation - not multi-tenant secure

### Memory System Security

- **Data Persistence**: Memory entries stored in plaintext JSON
- **Access Control**: No authentication or authorization implemented
- **Audit Trail**: Basic logging only - not tamper-proof

### Recommended Production Practices

For production deployments:

1. **Replace Trust System**: Implement proper certificate-based agent authentication
2. **Encrypt Storage**: Use AES-256 encryption for memory persistence
3. **Network Security**: Deploy with TLS/SSL and proper firewall rules
4. **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input sanitization
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security event logging and alerting

### Known Limitations

- Agent code execution is not sandboxed
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- Pattern matching uses regex without DoS protection
- LLM API keys stored in environment variables only

### Organization Security Features

IOA Organization provides enhanced security features:
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Advanced audit trails with tamper detection
- Multi-tenant isolation with cryptographic boundaries
- Compliance frameworks (SOC2, ISO 27001)

For organization security requirements, contact: `organization@orchintel.com`

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **API Key Management**: Use secure key management systems, not `.env` files in production
2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs before processing
3. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities

### For Deployment

1. **Network Isolation**: Deploy IOA Core in isolated network segments
2. **Access Controls**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. **Updates**: Maintain current versions and security patches

## Compliance and Regulations

### GDPR Compliance

IOA Core includes basic data handling but requires additional implementation for GDPR compliance:
- `memory_engine.purge_entries()` provides basic erasure capability (stub implementation)
- Data portability features available in JSON export format
- Consent management must be implemented at application level

### Other Regulations

For compliance with industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, SOX, etc.), additional security controls are required beyond IOA Core's basic implementation.
