# IOA Code Examples

This document provides practical code examples for the **Intelligent Orchestration Architecture (IOA)** Core (v2.4.8), developed by OrchIntel Systems Ltd. Examples include error handling and real-world context. For full API details, see module docstrings.

## 1. Agent Onboarding
```python
from src.agent_onboarding import AgentOnboarding, OnboardingError
import hashlib

onboarder = AgentOnboarding(base_dir="<project>.ioa")
manifest = {
    "agent_id": "analyzer_001",
    "adapter_class": "llm_adapter.LLMService",
    "capabilities": ["analysis"],
    "tenant_id": "default",
    "trust_signature": hashlib.sha256(b"secure_key_001").hexdigest(),
    "metadata": {"name": "Market Analyzer", "version": "1.0.0"}
}
try:
    result = onboarder.onboard_agent(manifest)
    print(result)  # {'status': 'success', 'agent_id': 'analyzer_001'}
except OnboardingError as e:
    print(f"Onboarding failed: {e}")  # e.g., "Invalid manifest: missing capabilities"
```

⚠️ Use secure keys in production.

## 2. Memory Ingestion

Ingest a news article for pattern discovery:

```python
from src.memory_engine import MemoryEngine, MemoryError
from src.storage_adapter import InMemoryStorageService

storage = InMemoryStorageService()
memory = MemoryEngine(storage)
entry = {"raw_ref": "Tech layoffs surge in 2025, but AI startups raise $104B"}
try:
    memory_id = memory.remember(entry)
    print(f"Entry ingested: ID {memory_id}")
except MemoryError as e:
    print(f"Ingestion failed: {e}")  # e.g., "Invalid schema: missing pattern_id"
```

This triggers digestion (VAD in `refinery_utils.py`) and pattern weaving (`pattern_weaver.py`).

## 3. Pattern Weaving

Cluster patterns from memory:

```python
from src.pattern_weaver import PatternWeaver, PatternError

weaver = PatternWeaver()
entries = [{"raw_ref": "Tech layoffs surge"}, {"raw_ref": "AI startups raise $104B"}]
try:
    patterns = weaver.run_batch(entries)
    print(patterns[0])  # e.g., {'pattern_id': 'market_impact', 'confidence': 0.65}
except PatternError as e:
    print(f"Weaving failed: {e}")  # e.g., "Low confidence: <0.5"
```

## 4. Roundtable Consensus

Orchestrate agents for task resolution:

```python
import asyncio
from src.roundtable_executor import RoundtableExecutor, RoundtableError
from src.agent_router import AgentRouter
from src.storage_adapter import InMemoryStorageService

router = AgentRouter(governance_config={"roundtable_mode_enabled": True})
storage = InMemoryStorageService()
roundtable = RoundtableExecutor(router, storage)

async def run_task():
    try:
        result = await roundtable.execute_roundtable(
            task="Analyze market trends",
            agents=["analyzer_001", "editor_001"]
        )
        print(result.consensus)  # e.g., "Mixed job market—retraining needed"
    except RoundtableError as e:
        print(f"Execution failed: {e}")  # e.g., "Consensus timeout"

asyncio.run(run_task())
```

# IOA Comparison with Other Frameworks

The **Intelligent Orchestration Architecture (IOA)**, developed by OrchIntel Systems Ltd, differentiates from competitors like LangChain, CrewAI, and Semantic Kernel through its focus on persistent memory, ethical governance, and multi-agent consensus. Below is a comparison table and analysis.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | IOA Core | LangChain | CrewAI | Semantic Kernel |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | ✅ (Roundtable consensus with weighted voting) | ✅ (Chaining workflows) | ✅ (Role-based agents) | ✅ (Closed-loop orchestration) |
| **Persistent Memory** | ✅ (Hot/cold tiering with schema v0.1.2) | ✅ (Basic caching) | ❌ (Task-focused) | ✅ (State management) |
| **Pattern Discovery** | ✅ (NLP clustering in `pattern_weaver.py`) | ✅ (Document loaders) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Ethical Governance** | ✅ (Reinforcement rewards/punishments) | ❌ | ✅ (Role constraints) | ❌ |
| **VAD Sentiment Analysis** | ✅ (Integrated in `refinery_utils.py`) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Open-Source License** | ✅ (Apache 2.0) | ✅ (MIT) | ✅ (MIT) | ✅ (MIT) |
| **Enterprise Extensions** | ✅ (Proprietary mood/NLP/cold storage) | ✅ (LangSmith paid) | ✅ (CrewAI Pro) | ✅ (Microsoft ecosystem) |
| **Scalability (Simulated)** | 10k entries, 0.001s hot recall | High for chaining | Medium for roles | High for .NET |
| **Community Focus** | ✅ (CONTRIBUTING.md, adapters) | ✅ (Large ecosystem) | ✅ (Simple API) | ✅ (Microsoft devs) |

## Detailed Analysis
- **Vs. LangChain**: LangChain excels in chaining workflows (e.g., document loaders + LLMs), but lacks IOA's persistent memory (hot/cold tiers) and ethical governance (reinforcement). IOA is better for long-term cognition (e.g., pattern evolution over sessions), while LangChain is stronger for quick integrations. Edge: IOA for multi-agent ethics (+30% adaptive in sims).
- **Vs. CrewAI**: CrewAI focuses on role-based agents (e.g., "CEO agent" for tasks), similar to IOA's routing, but no VAD sentiment or governance (rewards/punishments). IOA's consensus (weighted VAD) resolves disagreements better. Edge: IOA for collaborative depth (sims show +25% consensus accuracy).
- **Vs. Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's Semantic Kernel is great for .NET orchestration (closed-loops), but proprietary-heavy vs IOA's OSS core. No built-in memory like IOA's engine or bias mitigation. Edge: IOA for open extensibility and multi-LLM support.

IOA's strengths: Memory-driven (beyond task-only), ethical (governance stubs Phase 2), modular (adapters for any LLM). Weaknesses: Early-stage stubs vs competitors' maturity.
