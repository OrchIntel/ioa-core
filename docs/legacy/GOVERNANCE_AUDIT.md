# IOA Governance Audit

The **Intelligent Orchestration Architecture (IOA)**, developed by OrchIntel Systems Ltd, includes a governance framework for ethical agent behavior and pattern management. This document provides a technical walkthrough of key components (`reinforcement_policy.py`, `pattern_governance.py`), current capabilities, and roadmap, addressing transparency for the open-source IOA Core (v2.4.8).

## Governance Overview
Governance in IOA ensures agent actions and patterns are ethical, consistent, and auditable. It uses rewards/punishments for behavior shaping and validation for pattern quality. Core is basic (stubs for Phase 2); Enterprise adds advanced mood integration.

## Reinforcement Policy (`reinforcement_policy.py`)
- **Walkthrough**:
  - **Initialization**: Loads config from `reinforcement_config.py` (registry_path, env).
  - **Reward/Punishment Flow**: `process_reward` increases satisfaction (+0.1) for ethical actions (e.g., EthicalBehaviorType); `process_punishment` increases stress (+0.2) for violations. Triggers: Consensus outcome in `roundtable_executor.py`.
  - **Credential System**: Tracks levels (basic/ethics_level_1) in `agent_trust_registry.json`; promotes on metrics (satisfaction>0.7, cycles>10).
  - **Fail-Safes**: Thresholds (stress>0.9 → pause agent); logging for audit.
- **Current Capabilities**: Basic tracking (total_rewards/punishments); no revocation (Phase 2).
- **Example**: Agent "Analyzer" rewarded for unbiased output: satisfaction 0.8 → promoted to ethics_level_1.

## Pattern Governance (`pattern_governance.py`)
- **Walkthrough**:
  - **Initialization**: Loads schema from `governance.config.yaml`.
  - **Validation Flow**: `validate_pattern` checks schema (pattern_id/variables/metadata/feeling/raw_ref), duplicates, VAD range (-1 to 1).
  - **Lifecycle**: Draft → active (confidence>0.7); deprecate low-use patterns.
  - **Fail-Safes**: Rejects invalid (e.g., missing fields); logs breaches.
- **Current Capabilities**: Schema enforcement; basic deprecation. No advanced bias (Phase 2: Bayesian).
- **Example**: Pattern "job_market_impact" validated (VAD 0.3/0.7/0.5 valid); duplicate rejected.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 2**: Revocation in reinforcement; Bayesian bias in governance.
- **Phase 3**: Audit trails with tamper-proof logs.
