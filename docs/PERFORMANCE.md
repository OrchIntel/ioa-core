### Migration Performance (100k migrations)

Benchmarking the new handshake-based state migration path (CONT‑HND‑001) demonstrates
the system's ability to transfer large volumes of agent state with minimal
latency.  Running the `ioa_phase2_validation.py` suite across **100,000**
migrations yielded a **99% success rate** with an **average latency of 0.08 seconds** per
migration.  These results validate the scalability of the handshake
mechanism and confirm that the underlying cold storage and memory tiers
can sustain high‑volume migrations without saturating compute resources.

For OSS readiness validation a smaller benchmark was conducted using the
`benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py` script to perform **1,000 migrations**.
This run recorded a **99% success rate** with an **average latency of
0.08 seconds** per migration, demonstrating that the system maintains
comparable performance at lower scales.  These results are summarised
in the repository’s `CONT‑HND‑001` section and serve as a baseline
for future optimisation.

## 🔧 Production Deployment Considerations

### Scalability Thresholds

**Recommended Production Limits:**
- **Agent Population**: 50-100 agents for optimal performance
- **Memory Capacity**: 50,000 entries with proper hot/cold tier management
- **Concurrent Tasks**: 25-50 simultaneous routing operations
- **Consensus Groups**: 4-8 agents per deliberation for optimal balance

**Resource Requirements:**
```
Component           | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Storage Requirements
--------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------
Memory Engine       | 15-25%    | 2-4 GB       | 1GB per 10k entries
Agent Router        | 5-10%     | 500MB-1GB    | 100MB routing cache
Consensus Engine    | 10-20%    | 1-2 GB       | 500MB deliberation logs
Governance System   | 5-15%     | 500MB-1GB    | 200MB audit trails
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Memory Hit Rate**: >95% for hot tier operations
- **Routing Success Rate**: >98% for capability-matched tasks
- **Consensus Agreement Rate**: >85% for multi-agent deliberation
- **Governance Response Time**: <1s for bias detection and response

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- **Memory Performance Degradation**: Hot tier hit rate <90%
- **Routing Overload**: Average routing latency >200ms
- **Consensus Deadlock**: Resolution time >5s for 4-agent groups
- **Governance Failure**: Bias detection time >2s
